## About

This project was created as a jokeâ€“ all thanks to incessant posting of Craigslist dirt in our company Slack.

Many of the tools used for this project are *not* the right tools for the jobâ€“Â I was more interested in experimenting with new technologies. (react-scripts, react-fela, gh-pages, prettier, husky/lint-staged, docker, node, etc.)

The app consists of two partsâ€“Â the site itself ([./src](./src)) and a script to automatically update the site with new listings [./excavator.js](./excavator.js)). The "Dirt Excavator 3000" script runs 24/7 in a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/chrisheninger/freedirtalert.com/) container on my home network attached storage device. ðŸšœ ðŸšœ ðŸšœ
