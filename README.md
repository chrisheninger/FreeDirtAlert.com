## About

This project was created as a jokeâ€“ all thanks to incessant posting of Craigslist dirt listings in @synapsestudios' Slack.

Many of the tools used for this project are *not* the right tools for the jobâ€“Â I was more interested in experimenting with new technologies. (react-scripts, react-fela, gh-pages, prettier, husky/lint-staged, docker, node, etc.)

The app consists of two partsâ€“
1. the site itself ([./src](./src)) + ([./public](./public))
1. a nodejs script to automatically update the site with new listings ([./excavator.js](./excavator.js)). The "Dirt Excavator 3000" runs hourly in a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/chrisheninger/freedirtalert.com/) container on my home [network attached storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) device, a [Synology DiskStation](https://amzn.to/2zVaqe0).
